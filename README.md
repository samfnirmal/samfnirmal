![Dog Math GIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d184277d-b69b-4c4d-b10d-ef8fb8e935d8)🚀 Hey, I'm Sam — ML Nerd & Problem Solver

I'm a B.Tech IT 3rd-year student who mostly lives inside algorithms, ML models, optimization problems, and computer vision experiments.
If something involves logic, patterns, or breaking+fixing code at 3 AM… I’m in.
